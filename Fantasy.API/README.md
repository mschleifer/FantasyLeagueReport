# Fantasy.API
PUT SWID AND COOKIE STUFF local.settings.json
THIS ISN'T PUSHED TO REPO BY DEFAULT
ONCE DEPLOYED TO AZURE FUNCTIONS WE CAN SET UP AN APPSETTING TO PROVIDE THE SWID FOR PROD SECURELY
ALL THE COOKIE RELATED STUFF HAPPENS SECURELY FROM THE AZURE FUNCTION THAT WRAPS THE ESPN API LIBRARY

THE ONLY THING RETURNED TO BLAZOR IS THE RESULT OF THE API CALL
AZURE FUNCTION IS A NODE PROJECT THAT WRAPS THE API LIBRARY, UNFORTUNATELY WE'LL NEED NEW ENDPOINTS/TRIGGERS FOR EACH USEFUL
PIECE OF THE LIBRARY, but I can implement them one at a time as their needed (instead of all up front)
